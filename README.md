Sim-to-Real semantic segmentation for humanoid soccer robots

As the humanoid soccer robots are highly dependent on their visual perception to recognize different elements in the competition environment, they must be pro-vided with effective algorithms running on their low-end hardware. This paper proposes employing u-net architecture to perform semantic segmentation as a so-lution to meet the robot's needs during the match. However, there are challenges especially in terms of a proper and subject-related dataset. Besides annotating the dataset manually for semantic segmentation has some considerable difficulties. To give an instance, generating masks manually is time-consuming and error-prone. Thus, we took advantage of realistically simulating the match environment and generating large amounts of data and their corresponding mask automatically in a short amount of time. The synthetic dataset was used to train the model, and to evaluate the model, a manually annotated dataset, consisting of real images cap-tured from humanoid robots in the match environment, was produced. Although the proposed Sim-to-Real approach generated a dataset close to the real one, the results were not satisfying. To deal with this problem, the transfer learning tech-nique was used to fine-tune the network and achieve better accuracy in real game conditions.
